### About this game

A 2D Game made with Unity Personal.

I set out to make and finish a game rather than prototype a mechanic by trying it out and never finishing it. I originally was going to make a Gradius 3 type clone but put that on hold and tried out this Game Jam. I only attempted this Game Jam because I want to start getting into the habit of finishing short games.

This game is meant to be challenging but at the same time fun. It is definitely possible to finish within a minute.

### Can I use your game's code?

Yes! By all means go for it. This game was just a fun project, plus some of code I had to google because of I wanted to do XYZ but couldn't figure out for the life of me how to do it. For example, this piece of code I have in Player.cs:

```C#
transform.up = player.transform.position - transform.position;
```

This is to point the enemy towards the player if they're in sight. I want to say I came up with this line of code but I didn't. It came from this <a href = "http://answers.unity3d.com/answers/1141082/view.html">answer</a>.

Anyways, TLDR: Yes, use my code, my awful sprites, do whatever you want with it.
