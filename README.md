### About this game

A 2D Game made with Unity Personal.

I set out to make and finish a game rather than prototype a mechanic by trying it out and never finishing it. And so, with a week's worth of committment, Vector Shot was born. My first ever finished game that is playable

This game is meant to be challenging but at the same time fun.

### Can I use your game's code?

Yes! By all means go for it. This game was just a fun project, plus some of code I had to google because of I wanted to do XYZ but couldn't figure out for the life of me how to do it. For example, this piece of code I have in Player.cs:

```C#
transform.up = player.transform.position - transform.position;
```

This is to point the enemy towards the player if they're in sight. I want to say I came up with this line of code but I didn't. It came from this <a href = "http://answers.unity3d.com/answers/1141082/view.html">answer</a>.

Anyways, TLDR: Yes, use my code, my awful sprites, do whatever you want with it.
